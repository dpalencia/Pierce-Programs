My command!
My dominion!
Memory, heart and all opinion
Hide me, guide me
Dry my tears
Slowly taking back the years
By your command
By your command
By your command
No, I know
All I am and
We are not
We are not to blame
For all I have learned now
We are not to blame
Over and over
And over and over
And over you live it again
(Touch it, take it)
Make it your friend

[Ziltoid:]
You have not convinced mighty Ziltoid
I am so omniscient; if there were to be two omniscience's
I would be both
Prepare yourselves for the subjugation

Hide me, guide me
Dry my tears
By your command
Slowly taking back the years
Now I know
All I ask is
We are not
We are not to blame
For all I have learned now
We are not to blame
Over and over
and over and over
and over you live it again
(Touch it, take it)
Make it your friend
Oh.. the physical race
You're dying
Oh with physical grace

Gone too far from the universe
Gone too far for the way on home
Gone too far from the universe.. the universe

I'm flying
Over physical
I'm flying
Over physical waste
I'll keep it light, and stay awake
